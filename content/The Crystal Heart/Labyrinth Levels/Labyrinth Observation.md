# Labyrinth Observation (Or Why the Walls Have Eyes and Sometimes Teeth)

## The Lich Is Always Watching

Congratulations! You're now part of the Lich's favorite reality show: "Who Wants to Be a Lich's Snack?" The walls literally have eyes (and sometimes ears, and occasionally mouths with pointy teeth). The Labyrinth harvests energy from your heroic struggles and tragic failures through various methods:

### Observation Methods

1. **The Walls Themselves**
   - Don't lick them (we've lost too many idiots that way)
   - Don't talk about your plans near them
   - Don't make fun of the Lich's fashion choices
   - They're probably listening

2. **Special Challenge Rooms**
   - Extra deadly (how convenient!)
   - Usually contain something the Lich wants to study
   - Often feature your worst fears
   - Sometimes feature your best friend's worst fears (awkward!)

3. **Crystal Orbs**
   - Float around watching you stumble into traps
   - Record your most embarrassing moments
   - Probably used for the Lich's private collection
   - We're pretty sure he has a "Best of" compilation

4. **Memory Extraction Points**
   - Places that mess with your memories
   - Because why not make this even more fun?
   - Usually disguised as something helpful
   - Like that "free" memory vessel you just bought

## Energy Harvesting

### What Gets Harvested

1. **Emotional Energy**
   - Fear (most common)
   - Despair (second most common)
   - Hope (rare, but valuable)
   - Love (extremely rare, probably fake)

2. **Life Force**
   - Your vitality
   - Your memories
   - Your dreams
   - Your will to live (optional)

3. **Experiences**
   - Your successes
   - Your failures
   - Your near-death experiences
   - Your "I should have stayed in bed" moments

### How to Minimize Harvesting

1. **Stay Calm**
   - Panic is like candy to the Lich
   - Screaming is like dessert
   - Crying is like a full-course meal
   - Just... try to be boring

2. **Protect Your Memories**
   - Use memory vessels
   - Don't trust the red ones
   - Don't trust the blue ones
   - Actually, just don't trust anything

3. **Avoid Observation Nodes**
   - They're the crystal spheres that follow you
   - They look like they're judging you
   - They probably are
   - Just ignore them (they hate that)

## Common Mistakes

### The "I'm Being Watched" Paranoia
- You are being watched
- But that's no reason to be paranoid
- Well, maybe a little reason
- Just don't let it affect your performance

### The "I Can Outsmart the Lich" Delusion
- You can't
- He's been doing this for centuries
- He's seen it all
- He's probably laughing at your attempts

### The "This Seems Too Easy" Trap
- It is
- It's always a trap
- Even when it's not a trap, it's a trap
- Just assume everything is a trap

## In Conclusion

The good news? You're providing renewable energy! The bad news? Everything else about this situation. But hey, at least you're not alone in being watched!
