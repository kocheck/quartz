# Labyrinth Time Mechanics (Or Why Your Favorite Tavern Might Be a Library When You Get Back)

## The Basics of Temporal Confusion

Time in the Labyrinth is like a drunk wizard's experiment - it doesn't work the way it should, and everyone's too afraid to ask why. Here's what we know (or think we know):

### The Time Dilation Effect

- For every level you complete in the Labyrinth, approximately **one year** passes in Sanctuary
- This means your favorite bartender might be dead when you get back (or worse, retired)
- That cute shopkeeper you flirted with might have grandchildren now
- Your favorite tavern might become a library or a public bath while you're away
- Don't leave your laundry hanging when you go adventuring

### Practical Implications

1. **Don't Make Long-Term Plans**
   - Unless you're planning to stay in Sanctuary
   - Even then, don't make plans. The Lich might get bored and rearrange everything

2. **Keep Track of Time**
   - Use the Chronomarking system
   - "I'll meet you for drinks in Sanctuary-time, not Labyrinth-time" is an important distinction
   - If someone says "see you next week," ask them to specify which time zone they're using

3. **Family Planning**
   - If you're thinking about starting a family, remember:
     - Your child might be older than you when you get back from a long expedition
     - Your spouse might have moved on (or died of old age)
     - Your pet might have evolved into a new species

4. **Business Considerations**
   - Don't invest in long-term projects
   - Don't start a business that requires regular maintenance
   - Don't plant trees (they'll be dead before you get back)
   - Don't make promises you can't keep in multiple time zones

## Common Time-Related Problems

### The "Where Did Everyone Go?" Syndrome
- You leave for a quick dungeon crawl
- Come back to find your favorite bar is now a museum
- The museum is dedicated to "The Great Adventurer Who Never Returned"
- The adventurer in question is you

### The "I'm My Own Grandfather" Paradox
- Time dilation can create some interesting family trees
- If you're not careful, you might end up being your own ancestor
- The Archives have several documented cases
- They're not sure if this is a bug or a feature

### The "I Missed My Own Funeral" Incident
- Common enough that there's a support group
- They meet every other Tuesday
- Or is it every other year?
- No one's really sure anymore

## Tips for Dealing with Time Dilation

1. **Keep a Journal**
   - Write down everything
   - Include dates in both Labyrinth and Sanctuary time
   - Don't be surprised if you find entries you don't remember writing

2. **Make Friends with Time-Travelers**
   - They understand your problems
   - They can warn you about future events
   - They might be you from the future
   - Don't ask too many questions

3. **Stay Flexible**
   - Your favorite restaurant might be a blacksmith's shop when you get back
   - Your best friend might be your great-grandchild
   - Your house might be a historical landmark
   - Roll with it

## In Conclusion

Time is an illusion. Labyrinth time is a particularly cruel illusion. But hey, at least you're not alone in your temporal confusion!
