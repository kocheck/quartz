# The Adventurer's (Mostly) Complete Guide to Not Dying Horribly in the Labyrinth

## DON'T PANIC

(And don't forget to get your complimentary towel from the Surplus Sorcery Emporium. Yes, it's *actually* free. No, we don't know why Magnus is giving away towels. Just take one before he changes his mind.)

Welcome, fresh meat—er, I mean, valued new adventurer! Congratulations on your involuntary relocation to the Lich's Labyrinth. This magical booklet contains everything the Sanctuary City Guard thinks you should know about staying alive long enough to become a productive member of our trapped society.

Touch this booklet now to magically bind it to yourself. Go ahead, we'll wait.

*Did you do it? Great! This guide will now magically reappear on your person whenever you walk through a dungeon gate. Convenient, right? Almost like someone doesn't want you to have any excuse for dying stupidly!*

## So You've Been Trapped in a Magical Death Maze

You're now in **The Lich's Labyrinth**, a 100-level dungeon created by **Archmage Vexilar**, a lich with way too much time on his hands and questionable hobbies. This massive structure exists in its own pocket dimension and serves as both a prison for everyone trapped here (that's you now, congrats!) and an experimental facility where Vexilar harvests your experiences and life force. Fun!

Every fifth level connects to the **Village of Sanctuary**, the settlement where people like you eventually built a society after realizing they were permanently stuck here. Sanctuary is your base of operations and the only place where you can go more than three days without something trying to eat your face.

## Important Things That Will Probably Keep You Alive

### Time Is Weird Here

Time flows differently between the Labyrinth and Sanctuary. For every level you complete in the Labyrinth, approximately **one year** passes in Sanctuary. This means:

- When you return from even a short expedition, everyone in the Village will be talking about "the good old days" when you were around
- That shopkeeper who overcharged you might be dead when you get back (or might have grandchildren who also overcharge you)
- Your favorite tavern might become a library or a public bath while you're away
- Don't leave your laundry hanging when you go adventuring

### Vexilar Is Watching You

The walls literally have eyes (and sometimes ears, and occasionally mouths with pointy teeth). The Labyrinth harvests energy from your heroic struggles and tragic failures through:

- The walls themselves (don't lick them)
- Special challenge rooms that are extra deadly (how convenient!)
- Crystal orbs that float around watching you stumble into traps
- Places that mess with your memories (because why not?)

The good news? You're providing renewable energy! The bad news? Everything else about this situation.

### How to Level Up (Without Dying)

1. **Survive Encounters**: Defeat monsters, solve puzzles, avoid traps. You know, standard adventuring stuff.
2. **Complete Levels**: Each level of the Labyrinth contains challenges that will strengthen you.
3. **Visit the Expeditionary Guild**: After returning to Sanctuary, get your Level Marker tattoo updated at the Vanguard Hall. It's both a badge of honor and your adventuring resume.
4. **Train with Experts**: Several masters in Sanctuary offer specialized training for a fee.
5. **Don't Die**: Self-explanatory, but surprisingly difficult.

## [[Sanctuary]]: Your New Forever Home

The Village occupies a pocket dimension approximately one mile in diameter with an impenetrable magical fog at its boundaries. At its center stands the Sanctuary Gate, connecting to every fifth level of the Labyrinth.

### Where to Spend Your Hard-Earned Loot

- **The First Step:** Keeper Bram's hostel for new arrivals. First week is free; after that, it's pay or get comfortable sleeping in alleys.
- **The Surplus Sorcery Emporium:** Magnus's ridiculous magic shop. Items may explode, transform you, or occasionally work as advertised.
- **Curious Curios:** Grundle's artifact shop. If you found something weird in the Labyrinth and don't know what it does, Grundle will buy it (for much less than it's worth).
- **Elara's Hospice:** Medical care when you inevitably get stabbed, poisoned, cursed, or all three. Donation-based, but don't be cheap if you want both arms healed.
- **The Vanguard Hall:** Captain Elowen's expedition headquarters. Register your adventuring party here to receive minimal benefits and maximum bureaucracy.
- **The Archives:** Elder Moira's historical repository. Learn from other people's fatal mistakes instead of making your own!
- **Maven's Grove:** Food and plants and stuff. Surprisingly important when you're trapped in an extradimensional prison.

## People Who Are Mildly Important

### Village Leaders (Who Will Judge Your Life Choices)

- **Thorne Ironshackle:** Grumpy dwarf who runs the Council of Elders. Has seen too many adventurers die to be impressed by your shiny new sword.
- **Captain Elowen Steelheart:** Leads the Expeditionary Guild. Will help you if you fill out the forms in triplicate.
- **Brother Luminous:** Creepily cheerful leader of the Vexilar Faithful. Thinks our imprisonment is a blessing.
- **Magister Valandros:** Head of the Arcanum Collective. Will talk about magical theory until you fake your own death to escape the conversation.
- **Elder Moira Trueheart:** Village Historian. Actually interesting to talk to, if you like stories about people who died horribly.

### Labyrinth Residents (Who Somehow Haven't Died Yet)

- **Sariel Nightshade:** Wood elf who guides visitors through the Menagerie levels. Probably half-plant by now.
- **The Curator:** Mysterious entity in the Memory Halls. Don't make eye contact.
- **Voran Cinderspark:** Fire genasi who studies the Machinery levels. Has eyebrows that occasionally catch fire.
- **Lyra Whisperwind:** Tiefling rogue who knows the Laboratory levels. Charges exorbitant fees for information that might save your life.
- **Grimjaw:** Altered human leading a community in the Failed Experiments levels. Has extra eyes in places eyes shouldn't be.
- **Kaddim the Unbound:** Githzerai monk navigating Temporal Distortion levels. Sometimes talks to you before you've met him.
- **Commander Drayke:** Human fighter leading resistance in the deep levels. Extremely dramatic.

## Pick a Side (Or Don't, We're Not Your Mom)

Several organized groups operate within Sanctuary, each with their own goals:

- **The Council of Elders:** Old people who want everyone to stop trying to escape and just accept their fate.
- **The Expeditionary Guild:** Adventurers who explore the Labyrinth, often getting themselves killed in exciting new ways.
- **The Vexilar Faithful:** Religious zealots who worship our captor. Avoid eye contact at parties.
- **The Arcanum Collective:** Scholars studying the Labyrinth's magic who need adventurers to gather research materials (and definitely won't cry if you die doing it).
- **The Liberation Front:** Radicals who want to destroy Vexilar and escape. Not technically outlawed, but don't mention them around the guards.

## How Not to Die (Immediately)

1. **Make Friends:** Especially the kind who sell healing potions at reasonable prices.
2. **Map Everything:** The Labyrinth shifts sometimes. Also, your memory is terrible.
3. **Pack Smart:** There are shops every fifth level, not every five minutes.
4. **Look for Patterns:** Energy harvesting spots, guardian patrol routes, trap triggers—they all follow patterns.
5. **Time Your Returns:** Remember that time dilation thing? Plan your Sanctuary visits accordingly.
6. **Trade Information:** Knowledge about unexplored levels is worth its weight in gold (which is technically zero weight, but you get the idea).
7. **Create Supply Caches:** Hide extra supplies at strategic locations for your future self.
8. **Learn Hand Signals:** Previous explorers developed silent communication for a reason.
9. **Protect Important Memories:** The Memory Halls can extract them. Write stuff down.
10. **Be Adaptable:** The Labyrinth changes to counter successful strategies, like a petty game master.

## Words You Should Probably Know

- **The Ascended One:** What the Vexilar Faithful call our captor. Eye-rolling is considered rude.
- **Chronomarking:** Dating system that accounts for time dilation. "I'll meet you for drinks in Sanctuary-time, not Labyrinth-time" is an important distinction.
- **Energy Harvesting:** How Vexilar extracts power from your suffering. Try not to think about it too much.
- **Founders:** People who built Sanctuary while you were still blissfully unaware of the Labyrinth's existence.
- **Labyrinth Salvage:** Fancy name for "stuff you looted from dungeons."
- **Level Markers:** Tattoos showing how deep you've gone. Size doesn't matter, depth does.
- **Memory Vessels:** Containers for keeping important memories safe. Like external brain storage.
- **Observation Nodes:** Crystal spheres that let Vexilar watch you trip over your own feet.
- **Pathfinder Codes:** Secret marks left by previous adventurers. Learn them if you want to live.
- **Sanctuary Gate:** The portal connecting the Village to every fifth Labyrinth level. Your new best friend.
- **Seekers:** Newcomers who actively explore the Labyrinth. That's you!
- **The Settled:** People who've given up on escape and focus on making Sanctuary comfortable.
- **The Shadows:** Whispered name for resistance movements. The City Guard officially denies their existence.

## In Conclusion

You're trapped in a magical death labyrinth created by an ancient lich who feeds on your experiences. Your new neighbors include religious zealots, bureaucratic adventurers, and people who've been altered by magical radiation. Time doesn't work properly, the walls are literally watching you, and your survival depends on your ability to adapt to increasingly deadly challenges.

But hey, free towel!

*Note: This guide will update itself periodically with new information. If you see writing appear that nobody else can see, that's perfectly normal and definitely not a sign of impending madness.*
