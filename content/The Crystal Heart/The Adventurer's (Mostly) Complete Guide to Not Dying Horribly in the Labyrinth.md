# The Adventurer's (Mostly) Complete Guide to Not Dying Horribly in the Labyrinth

## DON'T PANIC

(And don't forget to get your complimentary towel from the Surplus Sorcery Emporium. Yes, it's *actually* free. No, we don't know why Magnus is giving away towels. Just take one before he changes his mind.)

Welcome, fresh meat—er, I mean, valued new adventurer! Congratulations on your involuntary relocation to the Lich's Labyrinth. This magical booklet contains everything the Sanctuary City Guard thinks you should know about staying alive long enough to become a productive member of our trapped society.

Touch this booklet now to magically bind it to yourself. Go ahead, we'll wait.

*Did you do it? Great! This guide will now magically reappear on your person whenever you walk through a dungeon gate. Convenient, right? Almost like someone doesn't want you to have any excuse for dying stupidly!*

## So You've Been Trapped in a Magical Death Maze

You're now in **The Lich's Labyrinth**, a 100-level dungeon created by **Archmage Vexilar**, a lich with way too much time on his hands and questionable hobbies. This massive structure exists in its own pocket dimension and serves as both a prison for everyone trapped here (that's you now, congrats!) and an experimental facility where Vexilar harvests your experiences and life force. Fun!

Every fifth level connects to the **Village of Sanctuary**, the settlement where people like you eventually built a society after realizing they were permanently stuck here. Sanctuary is your base of operations and the only place where you can go more than three days without something trying to eat your face.

## Important Things That Will Probably Keep You Alive

## Recent Chronicles & Adventures

### Your Journey Begins
See [[First Day Survival Chronicle]] for a delightfully detailed account of your first stumbling steps into this wonderful reality. Yes, I was watching. Yes, I took notes. No, you can't have privacy - this is a lich's dungeon, not a spa retreat!

*Fresh off the crystal transport and already making interesting choices? How refreshing! Most groups just panic and start stabbing things. You magnificent specimens actually used your brains! Well, mostly.*

## How Not to Die (Immediately)

See [[Labyrinth Survival Tips]] for detailed survival strategies and best practices.

## Words You Should Probably Know

See [[Labyrinth Glossary]] for a complete list of important terms and their definitions.

## In Conclusion

You're trapped in a magical death labyrinth created by an ancient lich who feeds on your experiences. Your new neighbors include religious zealots, bureaucratic adventurers, and people who've been altered by magical radiation. Time doesn't work properly, the walls are literally watching you, and your survival depends on your ability to adapt to increasingly deadly challenges.

But hey, free towel!

*Note: This guide will update itself periodically with new information. If you see writing appear that nobody else can see, that's perfectly normal and definitely not a sign of impending madness.*

### Memory Management

The Labyrinth slowly consumes memories over time. To protect yourself:

- Purchase Memory Vessels (50 gold each at the Surplus Sorcery Emporium)
- Vessels fill up over time and vibrate when full
- Don't require attunement slots
- Must be attuned to protect memories
- Can be found in the Labyrinth or purchased in Sanctuary
- Don't break them (seriously, don't)

### The First Five Floors

The initial levels of the Labyrinth tell the story of how Vexar created everything:

- Located in Vexar's mansion on his island
- Must complete all five floors before returning to Sanctuary
- Contains clues about the Labyrinth's creation
- Various theories about its purpose:
  - Dimensional gateway for energy siphoning
  - Living phylactery machine
  - Other unknown purposes
- Important Note: Don't sit on any chairs
