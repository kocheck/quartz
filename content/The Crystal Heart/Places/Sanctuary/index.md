# The Sanctuary Survival Guide (Or How to Not Get Kicked Out of Your Only Safe Haven)

## Welcome to Your New Home (Whether You Like It or Not)

Congratulations on finding the only place in this entire pocket dimension where you won't be immediately eaten, cursed, or turned into a decorative plant! Sanctuary is your new home, your safe haven, and the only place where you can get a decent cup of tea without risking your life. Well, mostly without risking your life.

## The Basics (*Because Apparently Some People Need This Explained*)

Sanctuary is a one-mile diameter pocket dimension that exists between the levels of the Labyrinth. It's protected by an impenetrable magical fog (don't test this, we've lost enough idiots that way), and it's the only place where you can sleep without one eye open. Well, one eye open is still recommended, but that's more about your fellow residents than the environment.

### Time Is Still Weird Here

Remember how time works differently in the Labyrinth? Well, Sanctuary has its own temporal quirks:

- One year passes in Sanctuary for every level you complete in the Labyrinth

- This means your favorite tavern might be a library when you get back

- That cute shopkeeper you flirted with might be a grandparent now

- Don't make long-term plans unless you're planning to stay in Sanctuary

- Yes, this is confusing. No, we don't have a better explanation. Yes, we're working on it.

## Sanctuary's Layout (Or How to Not Get Lost in a One-Mile Circle)

*See the attached map for a detailed layout of Sanctuary. Yes, we know it's not to scale. No, we don't care. The important landmarks are there, and that's what matters.*

The city is organized in a roughly circular pattern, with the Sanctuary Gate at its center. The main districts are:

- **The Gate District:** Home to the Sanctuary Gate and the Vanguard Hall. Where all the important people pretend to be busy.

- **The Market Quarter:** Where you'll find most of the shops and services. Also where you'll lose most of your money.

- **The Residential District:** Where people actually live. Try not to make too much noise, some of these people have been here for centuries.

- **The Academic Quarter:** Home to the Archives and the Arcanum Collective. Where people talk about magic until your ears bleed.

- **The Garden District:** Maven's Grove and other green spaces. Surprisingly important when you're trapped in an extradimensional prison.

*Note: The map is updated periodically as new buildings are constructed or old ones collapse. If you find a building that isn't on the map, it's probably new. If you find a building on the map that doesn't exist, it probably collapsed while you were in the Labyrinth.*

## Where to Spend Your Hard-Earned Loot (Because You'll Need It)

### Essential Services (Or How to Not Die of Stupidity)

- **The First Step:** Keeper Bram's hostel for new arrivals. First week is free, after that it's pay up or sleep in the streets. And trust us, you don't want to sleep in the streets.

- **The Surplus Sorcery Emporium:** Magnus's magic shop. Items may explode, transform you, or occasionally work as advertised. No refunds, no complaints, no exceptions, free towels tho for some reason.

- **Curious Curios:** Grundle's artifact shop. If you found something weird in the Labyrinth and don't know what it does, Grundle will buy it (for much less than it's worth, but hey, better than dying from it).

- **Elara's Hospice:** Medical care when you inevitably get stabbed, poisoned, cursed, or all three. Donation-based, but don't be cheap if you want both arms healed.

- **The Vanguard Hall:** Captain Elowen's expedition headquarters. Register your adventuring party here to receive minimal benefits and maximum bureaucracy.

- **The Archives:** Elder Moira's historical repository. Learn from other people's fatal mistakes instead of making your own!

- **Maven's Grove:** Food and plants and stuff. Surprisingly important when you're trapped in an extradimensional prison.

### Important People (Who Will Judge Your Life Choices)

- **Thorne Ironshackle:** Grumpy dwarf who runs the Council of Elders. Has seen too many adventurers die to be impressed by your shiny new sword.

- **Captain Elowen Steelheart:** Leads the Expeditionary Guild. Will help you if you fill out the forms in triplicate.

- **Brother Luminous:** Creepily cheerful leader of the Vexilar Faithful. Thinks our imprisonment is a blessing.

- **Magister Valandros:** Head of the Arcanum Collective. Will talk about magical theory until you fake your own death to escape the conversation.

- **Elder Moira Trueheart:** Village Historian. Actually interesting to talk to, if you like stories about people who died horribly.

## Factions and Politics (Because Even in a Pocket Dimension, People Can't Get Along)

- **The Council of Elders:** Old people who want everyone to stop trying to escape and just accept their fate.

- **The Expeditionary Guild:** Adventurers who explore the Labyrinth, often getting themselves killed in exciting new ways.

- **The Vexilar Faithful:** Religious zealots who worship our captor. Avoid eye contact at parties.

- **The Arcanum Collective:** Scholars studying the Labyrinth's magic who need adventurers to gather research materials (and definitely won't cry if you die doing it).

- **The Liberation Front:** Radicals who want to destroy Vexilar and escape. Not technically outlawed, but don't mention them around the guards.

## How to Not Get Kicked Out (Because You Have Nowhere Else to Go)

1. **Pay Your Rent:** The First Step isn't free forever, and sleeping in the streets is a great way to get robbed or worse.

2. **Don't Cause Trouble:** The City Guard has enough to deal with without your shenanigans.

3. **Respect the Rules:** Yes, they seem arbitrary. Yes, they're probably for a good reason. No, we won't explain why.

4. **Make Friends:** Especially with people who sell healing potions at reasonable prices.

5. **Learn the Local Customs:** What's considered rude in your home dimension might be a compliment here, and vice versa.

6. **Keep Your Secrets:** Everyone has them, and everyone's watching.

7. **Don't Trust Everyone:** But don't trust no one either. That's just paranoia, like you could trust me...

8. **Stay Informed:** The Archives are your friend, even if Elder Moira's stories are a bit... graphic.

9. **Be Useful:** The more you contribute to Sanctuary, the more likely people are to help you when you need it.

10. **Remember Your Place:** You're new here. Act like it bitch.

## Words You Should Know (Because We're Not Explaining This Twice)

- **The Ascended One:** What the Vexilar Faithful call our captor. Eye-rolling is considered rude.

- **Chronomarking:** Dating system that accounts for time dilation. "I'll meet you for drinks in Sanctuary-time, not Labyrinth-time" is an important distinction.

- **Founders:** People who built Sanctuary while you were still blissfully unaware of the Labyrinth's existence.

- **Level Markers:** Tattoos showing how deep you've gone. Size doesn't matter, depth does. ðŸ‘€

- **Sanctuary Gate:** The portal connecting the Village to every fifth Labyrinth level. Your new best friend.

- **Seekers:** Newcomers who actively explore the Labyrinth. That's you!

- **The Settled:** People who've given up on escape and focus on making Sanctuary comfortable.

- **The Shadows:** Whispered name for resistance movements. The City Guard officially denies their existence.

## In Conclusion

You're trapped in a magical pocket dimension that's the only safe haven in a death labyrinth. Your new neighbors include religious zealots, bureaucratic adventurers, and people who've been altered by magical radiation. Time doesn't work properly, everyone's watching you, and your survival depends on your ability to adapt to increasingly deadly challenges.

But hey, at least you're not alone!

*Note: This guide will update itself periodically with new information. If you see writing appear that nobody else can see, that's perfectly normal and definitely not a sign of impending madness.*
