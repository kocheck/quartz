# The Crystal Heart Campaign

In a realm where magic flows like water and ancient mysteries lie waiting to be uncovered, you find yourself drawn into a tale that will test your courage, wisdom, and strength. The Crystal Heart Campaign invites you to embark on an epic journey through a closed world of wonder and danger.

## Essential Reading

Before you begin your journey, make sure to consult [[The Adventurer's (Mostly) Complete Guide to Not Dying Horribly in the Labyrinth|The Adventurer's Guide]]. This living document, maintained by the Sanctuary City Guard, contains crucial information about surviving in the Labyrinth. The guide magically updates itself between expeditions, incorporating new discoveries and warnings from recent adventurers. While some of its advice might seem... unorthodox, it's better to be prepared than to learn the hard way.
