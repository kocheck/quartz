## Current Quest Board

### Golden Tree Fruit Investigation
**Quest Giver**: Maven (Expeditionary Guild Agricultural Coordinator)
**Location**: Vanguard Hall
**Reward**: 100 gold pieces
**Difficulty**: Low (Investigation/Social)

**The Situation**: Maven has noticed something odd about the golden tree fruit trade in Sanctuary. These valuable fruits only appear once per month, and there are some inconsistencies she'd like investigated.

**What You'd Do**:
- Talk to people involved in the fruit trade
- Ask around about cultivation methods
- Look into supply chains and distribution
- Figure out why the supply is so irregular

**Why It Matters**: Good practice for investigation work, decent pay, and Maven is well-connected in the Guild.
