# The Archives

*The big building where all the books live (and occasionally bite)*

---

## Overview
The Archives serve as Sanctuary's most comprehensive repository of knowledge, housed in a grand building with large marble doors and an impressive reception hall. Located within the Arcanum District, it's where you go when you need to know something important, and where scholars go to argue about commas.

## What You Can Find Here

### General Collections
- Common reference materials that won't get you arrested for reading
- Copies of important documents (the originals are locked away from people like you)
- Community resources for education (assuming you can read)
- Basic historical information about Sanctuary

### Historical Research Section
- Dusty tomes that make you sneeze
- Ancient records that may or may not be accurate
- Bean bag chairs (the real reason people come here)
- Supervised reading area (because apparently some people can't be trusted with books)

### Labyrinth Cartography Section
- Maps of explored Labyrinth levels (the parts we're willing to share)
- Notes on hazards, resources, and "please don't go here" areas
- Information crucial for not dying immediately upon entering a new floor

## Notable Features

### Reception Hall
- Large marble entrance doors (very impressive, we're told)
- Central reception desk where you can ask for help and be politely redirected
- Visitor pass distribution (because bureaucracy follows you everywhere)

### Climate-Controlled Repository
- Where the important stuff is kept at exactly the right temperature
- More secured than your personal belongings
- Contains things you're probably not allowed to see

### Research Laboratory
- Sophisticated equipment for studying memory crystals
- Unlimited budget (we assume, based on how fancy everything looks)
- Analysis tools that do things we don't fully understand

## Memory Crystal Research

The Archives maintain an active research program studying the memory crystals found throughout the Labyrinth:

### Known Crystal Types
- **Blue Crystals**: Standard memory storage, commonly found in early labyrinth levels
- **Red/Purple Crystals**: Enhanced storage, associated with the Crystal Heart
- **Storage Properties**: Fill over time, vibrate when full, require attunement

### What They're Studying
- How the crystals work (spoiler: nobody really knows)
- Why they exist (spoiler: nobody knows this either)
- Memory preservation techniques (this one they might actually figure out)
- Crystal distribution patterns (helpful for finding more)

## Important People

**Archivist Thellem Vex** - The person in charge of all the books. Very serious about proper research protocols and not letting people touch the expensive things.

**Mira** - Research assistant who actually knows where everything is. Much more helpful than the fancy catalog system.

**Aldrich Dustwater** - Historian who specializes in old documents and making them readable again.

## Access Rules

- General Collections: Open to all residents (yes, even you)
- Historical Repository: Scholars with appropriate credentials (not you, probably)
- Personal Records: Officials only (definitely not you)
- Restricted Archives: Don't even think about it

### What You Need to Know
- Register when you enter (they like to know who's touching their books)
- No eating or drinking near the documents (apparently old parchment doesn't like coffee)
- Some areas require special passes (available at the front desk if you qualify)
- Magical detection wards monitor for unauthorized copying (they're serious about this)

## Current Happenings

- New magical cataloging system occasionally misfiles documents in creative ways
- Restoration project attempting to recover information from water-damaged records
- Expansion project to accommodate growing collection of expedition records
- Increased security due to recent concerns about document tampering
- Oral history program recording memories of Sanctuary's oldest residents

## Practical Information

**Hours**: Generally open during daylight hours, though researchers often work late

**Location**: Arcanum District, the big building with the marble doors (you can't miss it)

**Cost**: Free for basic access, fees for specialized research assistance

**What to Bring**: Your questions, patience, and respect for other people's books

*"The Archives contain the sum of our knowledge about this place. That's either very reassuring or deeply terrifying, depending on how much you think we actually know."*
