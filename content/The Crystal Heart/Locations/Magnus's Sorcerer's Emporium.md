# Magnus's Sorcerer's Emporium - Shopping Guide

*Where your money goes to die, but at least you get something magical in return (probably)*

---

## Overview
Welcome to the most flamboyant magical shop in Sanctuary! Magnus's Surplus Sorcery Emporium is impossible to miss - just look for the gaudy purple and gold building that seems to assault your retinas from three blocks away. Magnus himself is equally hard to miss, being a large, bombastic man who treats every transaction like a theatrical performance.

## What You'll Find Here

### Standard Inventory
Magnus maintains a rotating stock of magical items, potions, and curiosities. The quality ranges from "surprisingly useful" to "how is this even legal to sell?" But hey, at least the prices are... well, they're prices.

### Memory Vessels
**Price**: 50 gp each

The most popular items in the shop. These crystals protect your memories from the Labyrinth's memory-affecting properties:
- Fill up over time with your memories
- Vibrate when full (time to find a replacement!)
- Available in blue (standard) and purple/red (from the deeper levels)
- Essential equipment for any serious Labyrinth explorer

### Health Potions - New Styles!
Magnus has recently introduced his innovative health potion options:

**Chunky Style** - 45 gp
- "Like chunky peanut butter, but for your health!"
- Standard healing effects with visible lumps and chunks
- Magnus passes his "processing savings" onto you
- Features handwritten labels for that personal touch

**Smooth Style** - 50 gp
- Finely ground with mortar and pestle for smooth consistency
- Premium pricing for the extra processing time
- Same healing effects, just easier to swallow

*Magnus's explanation: "The chunky style saves me time, so I save you money! The smooth style takes more work, so you pay a little extra. It's all about honest business!"*

### Sample Table (Free!)
Magnus always has a sample table with free potions to try:
- **Temporary Levitation**: Float 3 feet high for 1 minute (may cause spinning)
- **Color Change**: Random color transformation for 1 hour (affects clothes too!)
- **Voice Amplification**: 3x louder voice for 10 minutes (may cause cracking)

*Note: Magnus encourages trying the samples, but warns that results may vary and he's not responsible for embarrassing side effects.*

### Questionable High-End Items
Magnus also stocks incredibly expensive items of dubious authenticity:
- **Raging Blazing Poisonous Sword of Doom** (20,000 gp) - "Definitely real!"
- **Crown of Infinite Knowledge** (50,000 gp) - "Works sometimes!"
- **Ring of Wish Granting** (100,000 gp) - "No refunds if the wish goes wrong!"

*General consensus: These are probably not what they claim to be, but Magnus is very entertaining when describing them.*
